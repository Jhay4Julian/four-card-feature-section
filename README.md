## âœ¨ What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

- Creating responsive layouts with **Tailwind CSS Grid and Flexbox**
- Making reusable components in React
- Aligning and positioning elements (like icons to bottom-right)
- Using custom colors with **HSL and HEX** via Tailwindâ€™s arbitrary value syntax
- Adding subtle interactivity with `hover:` and `active:` states for better UX
